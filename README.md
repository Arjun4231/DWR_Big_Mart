BIGMART SALES
FORECASTING PROJECT
Project Summary
This repository contains a machine learning solution aimed at forecasting sales for BigMart’s products across multiple store locations. By analyzing historical sales data, this project uncovers the relationships between various product and store attributes and their impact on sales. This predictive model enables BigMart to make informed decisions for inventory management and store operations.

Purpose
The objective is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting sales figures for individual products at BigMart locations. With data provided on products and stores, the model aims to forecast sales outcomes for over a thousand product-store combinations, even in cases where data may be partially incomplete.

Data Overview
The dataset includes detailed information on products (such as type, weight, and visibility) and stores (such as size, location, and type). This information spans 1559 products across 10 stores, each with its own characteristics. Addressing missing values and data inconsistencies is crucial to achieve meaningful predictions from this dataset.

Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and prepared the data to be model-ready.
Feature Development: Engineered additional features to enhance the predictive quality of the model.
Model Selection: Explored and fine-tuned several algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
Performance Evaluation: Measured model accuracy using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to ensure reliable predictions.
Key Findings
The model’s output, stored in submission.csv, provides sales predictions for each product-store combination. This solution sheds light on key drivers of sales across different stores and products, offering actionable insights to support BigMart’s strategic planning.
